0. Make sure that the SpatialKappa jar file has been built, either
   using Eclipse, or using the Makefile in the directory above.

1. Install py4j, either (a) in standard system location:
   
   sudo easy_install-2.7 py4j

   or (b) in a user directory, e.g.:
   
   easy_install-2.7  --install-dir=${HOME}/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ py4j

2. Install SpatialKappa python files
   
   sudo python2.7 setup.py install
   # python2.7 setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}

3. Run the test:

   cd test/launch-SpatialKappa
   python2.7 launch-SpatialKappa.py
   
   This gives an indication of what methods are exposed to python.
